# Nomenclature: Audio Transcription Workflows

*Generated: December 7, 2025 by Claude Code, Opus 4.5*

This document provides five accurate descriptors for each of the three distinct audio-to-text workflows.

---

## Workflow A: Raw ASR Transcription

Pure speech-to-text conversion without post-processing or intelligent formatting.

| # | Term | Usage Context |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | **Raw ASR** | Technical/engineering contexts |
| 2 | **Verbatim Transcription** | Professional transcription industry |
| 3 | **Faithful Speech Recognition** | Academic research |
| 4 | **Unprocessed STT** | Developer documentation |
| 5 | **Literal Transcription** | Legal/medical transcription |

### Notes on Terminology

- "Verbatim" is the industry-standard term in professional transcription services
- "Raw" emphasizes the unprocessed nature of the output
- Some vendors use "full verbatim" to distinguish from "clean verbatim" (which removes filler words)

---

## Workflow B: Cascaded/Pipeline ASR

Two-stage approach: ASR for transcription, followed by LLM for text refinement.

| # | Term | Usage Context |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | **Cascaded Speech Processing** | Academic literature |
| 2 | **ASR+LLM Pipeline** | ML engineering |
| 3 | **Two-Stage Transcription** | Technical documentation |
| 4 | **Post-Processed ASR** | Industry usage |
| 5 | **Hybrid Transcription Pipeline** | Enterprise solutions |

### Notes on Terminology

- "Cascade" is the established term in speech processing literature for sequential model chaining
- "Pipeline" is preferred in MLOps and production contexts
- Some vendors market this as "AI-enhanced transcription" or "intelligent transcription"

## Workflow C: Native Audio Multimodal

Single multimodal model that processes audio tokens with text prompts for unified inference.

| # | Term | Usage Context |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | **Native Audio Multimodal** | Technical/research |
| 2 | **Prompt-Guided Audio Understanding** | LLM vendor documentation |
| 3 | **End-to-End Audio LLM** | Academic papers |
| 4 | **Unified Audio-Language Model** | Research literature |
| 5 | **Audio-Native Foundation Model** | Industry marketing |

### Notes on Terminology

- "Multimodal" is the Hugging Face classification term
- "End-to-end" emphasizes the single-inference nature
- "Native" distinguishes from models that use embedded ASR components
- Vendors often use "audio understanding" rather than "audio transcription" to emphasize broader capabilities

## Cross-Reference: Alternative Terms by Region/Community

| Concept | US/Tech Industry | EU/Academic | Asia/Emerging Markets |
|---------|------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Raw ASR | STT, Speech-to-Text | ASR, Speech Recognition | Voice Recognition |
| Pipeline | Cascade, Chain | Sequential Processing | Multi-model Pipeline |
| Multimodal Audio | Audio LLM | Audio Foundation Model | Omnimodal |

## Terminology Evolution

The field is rapidly evolving. Key observations:

1. **"Multimodal" is overloaded** - now encompasses vision, audio, video, and combinations
2. **"ASR" vs "STT"** - largely interchangeable, though ASR is more academic
3. **"Audio Understanding"** - emerging term that encompasses transcription + analysis
4. **"Omnimodal"** - GPT-4o introduced this term for simultaneous multi-modality support

As of December 2025, there is no universally agreed-upon nomenclature. The terms above represent the most common usage patterns across different communities.
