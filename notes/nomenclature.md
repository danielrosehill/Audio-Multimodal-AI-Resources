# Nomenclature

Slightly different verbiage can be used to describe the process through which an AI model can process ("understand") audio.

Likewise, different language can be used to describe the capability through rich text and audio can be processed together. 

## Google

Google uses the term "audio understanding" to describe the capability through which its multimodal models can analyze and understand audio input.

Google uses the terminology "file prompting" to [descibe](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/files#prompt-guide) the process of layering a text prompt on top of a "file" (like an audio binary). 

This language seems tied to the fact that the file is delivered through the "Files API." Notably - at the time of writing - the file prompting guide covers vision-enabled prompting but not audio.
